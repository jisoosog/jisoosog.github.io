                        Japan has a lot of charming, interesting and amazing culture from what they eat to their way of
                        living. The most fascinating thing about their culture is that it varies so much from European
                        and American cultures. Especially their food and cartoons.

                    <p>
                        The biggest difference between their cuisine and ours is that theirs is much more refined and
                        sophisticated. Recently, Japanese cuisine has become a big hit in the USA and many parts of
                        Europe, because of the unique flavour and texture. This makes the people who haven’t experienced
                        this texture before almost addicted to it. Take sushi as an example. The way the Japanese chefs
                        prepare their ingredients is with the utmost care compared to a regular cheeseburger where you
                        cook the meat and melt some cheese to put it inside a bun.
                        If the food doesn’t interest you, their TV shows will.

                    <h2>Television てれびじょん </h2>
                    <p> In Japan, there’s one category of television that stands out as the best and most popular
                        according to the citizens, anime. Anime is almost like a cartoon with only a few differences,
                        one being the way the animators draw the characters. In anime, it is common for the main
                        character to have some sort of special treat that the others don’t. This can be a special power
                        or the way he/she dresses. Anime has become a popular thing, especially in western countries.
                        This is because the shows grow with the viewers in a way that regular TV shows don't, but also
                        because it is popular with kids and adults.

                        In Japan there are a variety of different traditions, some that might seem strange to
                        foreigners. There are traditions related to etique or politeness while some other traditions are
                        holidays, ceremonies and rituals.

                <div id="text1">
                    <p>A common festival that is celebrated in Japan in summer is named Obon. It is a three-day festival
                        that celebrates the ancestors' spirits that come home to rest. It is the japanese tradition of
                        floating lanterns in rivers known as Toro Nagashi. Obon is celebrated in summer because it is
                        the time of the year when it’s believed that the spirit of the loved ones returns home.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div id="txtrandom">
                    <p>Toro Nagashi officially begins at the moment the ancestors commence their return to the spirit
                        world. Families come together to guide the spirits down to the sea using traditional candle-lit
                        lanterns (toro). In the Japanese belief system, all humans originally came from water, so the
                        lanterns visually represent the spirits’ return to the elements.
                    </p>

                    <p>Toro Nagashi is often referred to by the alternative name of the Festival of Recovery, which ties
                        into the sad origins of the custom. It was first held in 1946 as a way to commemorate the lives
                        lost in the US bombings of Tokyo and other Japanese cities during World War II. This is why
                        you’ll find bigger public Toro Nagashi festivals at places such as Hiroshima, where 10,000
                        lanterns are set afloat. In Tokyo, the Asakusa celebration, held on the Sumida River,
                        commemorates those lost to the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.</p>

                <div id="text2">
                    <p>An important tradition that many may know of is bowing. Bowing is a gesture used in a lot of
                        situations in everyday life. Japanese people bow when they greet someone and when they take
                        their leave. Bowing is a way to show respect and gain trust, the longer you bow means more
                        respect. It is important to use proper etiquette when visiting Japan and bowing is one of the
                        things to have in mind when greeting and leaving. </p>

                <!--Text för hemsidan-->

                <div id="text3">
                    <p>Another common tradition in Japan is Onsen, which are hot spring public baths. In Japan there are
                        plenty of active volcanoes and that makes Japan the prime spot for hot spring baths. A majority
                        of Japanese onsen are nude-only to not risk contamination. </p>
                    <p>Onsens are part of a sacred tradition. The introduction of Buddhism promoted ritual bathing as a
                        part of being spiritually worthy and mindful, but even before Buddhism was introduced to the
                        country, natural hot springs were regarded as a gift from the gods. Onsens drive Japanese
                        tourism within the country, and many city-dwellers retreat to the remote outdoors in order to
                        enjoy the quiet healing of beautiful views and warm mineral springs. In fact, over 46% of
                        Japanese pleasure-seekers prefer a visit to the hot springs over travel overseas, a concert, or
                        a movie.</p>

                <p>There are plenty more traditions in Japan that are festivals, ceremonies and also etique. These three

                    you should follow and interesting festivals and ceremonies you can attend to.

                    <!--Text för hemsidan-->
                    <p>Japan's landscape is extraordinary and so are their structures. One of the famous structures is
                        the Himeji castle. It is to our knowledge, the best preserved samurai castle and it is also the
                        biggest one. Surrounded by sakura trees, it is one of the most famous sights in Japan.
                    </p>

                <div id="fuji">
                    <p>Another incredible place to visit is Mount Fuji. It is Japan's largest mountain and is worshipped
                        as a sacred place. It is a well shaped volcano with a height of 3776 meters and is still
                        classified as an active volcano.

                <div id="zao">
                    <p>If you’re not interested in structures or mountains a cool place to visit could be
                        the Zao Fox Village. This is a park where foxes walk around freely and you are allowed to hold
                        some of them for a smaller charge. Don’t expect all of the foxes to be interested in you though
                        since they mostly sleep and play.

                <div id="tokyo">
                    <p> A really interesting structure for you to go and see is the Tokyo Tower. It looks a bit like the
                        Eiffel Tower and is actually inspired by it. It is a red and white tower that works like a
                        communication tower and can be climbed by visitors.

                <div id="kyoto">
                    <p> The last site this text will take up is Imperial Kyoto. Kyoto is probably the most historical
                        city or town in Japan. Its architecture has barely changed in a 1000 years. Even in the imperial
                        times Kyoto was one of Japan's cultural centres and somehow it survived through the WWII
                        devestations and therefore still stands with its remarkable old designs.
